## Hi there!

## About me

### TLDR; 
Versatile, tech-savvy and curious coder that have a natural passion for problem solving and programming. I like to work with modern technologies and learn new things.
I am confident in Python, Javascript, Java and C++. I have an eye for design but prefer prefer backend. 

### Long story

My name is Sokrates and I am a developer based in Stockholm. I graduated with a BS in Programming and a BA in Cognitive Science from [Link√∂ping University](https://liu.se/). 
I work as a software developer where I code in Java but also many in-house languages. I have a keen interest in linguistics, artificial intelligence and other interdiciplinary fields of Cognitive Science. I like to learn new technologies, frameworks and languages. 

I started programming back in 2014 when I was studying Cognitive Science. I found the technical side of CogSci to be very facinating, however, I felt rather limited by my programming expertise and thereon I pursued a BS in Computer Science and programming. Upon starting to learn programming, I discovered an entire field that I was interested in, everything from web technologies, systems programming, networks, information theory, learning systems and video games etc. Lately, I have sort of side tracked from my initial interest in CogSci but I have some side projects that I would love to pick up soon. 

I pick up new languages with ease. I get around mainly in Javscript, C++, Python and Java. During my final year in University I wrote a static analyzer [FlakyHoover](https://github.com/socketopp/flakyhoover) that detect test smells that could induce flaky tests. I am currently devolping a voice command system that is suppose to change my computers playback device (from headset to speakers and vice versa). Code of this project will be uploaded once first draft is finished. Currently looking into machine learning models in Python for trigger word detection. 

### Q&A 

- *Are you named after the footballer or philosopher?* 

Good question. Neither, my parents decided to pick one name each; one Swedish and one Greek name.

- *What's Socketopp?*

Socketopp is a pun based on my nickname Socke, short for Sokrates. Socke*r*topp is sugarloaf (refined sugar in a cone).
